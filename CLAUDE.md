# Claude Code Commands

## Code Quality

### Linting and Formatting
- `npm run check` - Run Biome linting and formatting checks
- `npm run check:unsafe` - Run Biome linting and formatting with automatic fixes

These commands use Biome for code quality enforcement and should be run before committing changes to ensure consistent code style and catch potential issues.
